```javascript
// In a React functional component:

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const handleClick = () => {
    setCount(count + 1); // Potential issue here
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```
This is a simplified example.  The issue is that if `setCount` is called rapidly (e.g., within a loop or due to multiple events firing), React may not update the display as expected.  The issue is not directly related to React 19, but can be exacerbated by its optimizations or if the underlying state update mechanism is not fully understood.
